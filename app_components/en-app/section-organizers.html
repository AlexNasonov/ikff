                            <p>
                                It is the first time for Russia to be honored to host VI International Cultural Kung Fu
                                Festival and V International Kung Fu Federation Championship! Undoubtedly, it is a
                                decent reward for our entire country for its efforts to develop Kung Fu both nationally
                                and internationally. I would like to thank the International Kung Fu Federation for its
                                successful collaboration with the Kung Fu Federation of Russia.
                            </p>

                                The planet’s best athletes will go to the courts in Moscow very soon. Of course,
                                Russian team will compel special attention. We always expect high results from our
                                national team. I am sure they will manage to show spectacular demonstrations and
                                memorable fights!

                                International Kung Fu Federation Championship, first of all, to have self-confidence
