                    <h4>What You Can Expect</h4>
                    <p><strong>Arbat Street</strong> mainly referred to as <strong>the Arbat</strong>, is a
                        pedestrian street about one kilometer long in the historical center of Moscow.
                        The Arbat has existed since at least the 15th century, thus laying claim to being one of
                        the oldest surviving streets of the Russian capital. It forms the heart of the
                        Arbat District of Moscow. Originally the street formed part of an important trade route and was
                        home to a large number of craftsmen.</p>
                    <p>In the 18th century, the Arbat came to be regarded by the Russian nobility as the
                        most prestigious living area in Moscow. The street was almost completely destroyed by the great
                        fire during Napoleon's occupation of Moscow in 1812 and had to be rebuilt. In the 19th
                        and early 20th centuries it became known as the place where petty nobility, artists, and
                        academics lived. In the Soviet period, it was the home of many high-ranking government
                        officials.</p>
                    <p>Today the street and its surroundings are undergoing gentrification, and it is
                        considered a desirable place to live. Because of the many historic buildings, and the numerous
                        artists who have lived and worked in the street, the Arbat is also an important tourist
                        attraction.</p>
